## Testing User Stories

### First time visitor

- As a first time visitor, I want to be able to view the gallery with ease and navigate through pages.
  - The navigation is in the intuitive location and a gallery is presented on the landing page.
  - The site title and the 'galley' navigation both return users to the landing page.
  - Links bring you to expected pages as described.

- First time visitors want to understand the visual aesthetic quickly so they will want to explore the site.
  - The presentation of an immediate gallery has this effect and content is available on all pages with the exception of the contact page.

- As a first time visitor I want to know more about the photographer and where I can get more content.
  - The about page is there to give additional information in an easily consumed amount so as not to be overwhelming with text.
  - The link to instagram is clearly displayed on every page of the site.
  
- As a first time visitor I want to be able to feel connected to the site.
  - The latest image page allows a sense of connection by showing the viewer something new and fresh, assuring them that this is a site of new and up to date content.
