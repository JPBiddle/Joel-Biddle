# Introduction 

***

This portfolio website was designed as a waypoint between social media and as a platform to view photography in more depth, whilst also providing methods of contacting the site owner, myself. Additional information such as a bio and a timeline of exhibitions will also be included.

This website was created as the first of four milestone projects as part of my Web Development Diploma at Code Institure. 

The primary requirements are that the website be responsive, static and uses HTML and CSS. The site must be at least 3 Pages.


# UX

***

### Demographics

Users for this website will be as follows;
 * Existing social media followers
 * Users who are new
 * People looking to enjoy beautiful photographs

### User Stories

##### Current User

1. Current followers must be able to find new bio information and previous exhibition timelines easily.
2. Current followers must be able to easily navigate to a place to send a direct email message.
3. Content must be navigated in a small number of steps.

##### New User

1. New users must intuitively navigate the site.
2. New users must be able to find relevant information easily.
3. The site must be attractive enough to encourage return visits in future.

##### People looking for photos

1. These users must be able to navigate through the gallery easily.
2. Links to contact and social media must be accessible easily.

### Development Planes

To create a website that covers all of the answers to the user stories and is as functional as possible, the developer has to cover the main user needs, which includes access to a bio and exhibition list, a gallery, contact page and latest image page.

##### Strategy 
    
The strategy was broken down by focussing on the essential elements of a portfolio website, as well as the different types of users that would access these elements. 

- ### Roles:

  - Current followers
  - New users
  - Photography enthusiasts

- ### Demographic

  - All ages but typically adult
  - Residing in UK or USA
  - Keen interest in photography
  - Enjoys minimalist aesthetic
  

- ### Psychographic

  - Lifestyles:
    - Interest in photography
    - Potentially a photographer
    - Interest in the arts
  - Personality & Attitudes
    - Creative
    - Liberal
  
- ### Values

  - Interest in local community and local artists
  - Interest in the individual as opposed to corporation/business

The website needs to enable the user to:

- View content in an enjoyable way
- Find social media links
- Read about the artist
- Contact the artist
- View updates to content to feel current and connected to the content

The website needs to enable the site manager to:

-Recieve messages from users
-Update content when neccessary

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme chosen was minimal to reflect the stlye of the photography presented within the website.

The colour palette began with a plain white background. The photographs which make up the bulk of the website content are all black and white and therefore a white background is very appropriate to avoid becoming a distraction.

Text and headers are charcoal, rgb(78, 81, 106) as to fit with the minimal theme. When a navigation button is selected it becomes a salmon pink colour - rgb(255, 112, 112). This was to make it obvious which page was selected as initially the navigation buttons adopted a heavier font weight but when thewebsite was run through lighthouse there were accessability issues and it needed to be clearer.

The website header and back to top button was also the salmon pink and the subheader was a less saturated version of this colour -rgb(177, 114, 114) to allow the main header to be more attention grabbing.

This less saturated colour was also used as the colour to represent when a mouse hovers over a navigation.

#### Typography
The typography chosen was sourced from Google Fonts. 

My chosen font was 'Cormorant Garamond' with Serif as a backup.

A combination of font weights were deployed as well as a sparing use of italic font for the sub header and the selected exhibition header when in mobile mode.

#### Imagery
All imagery is original content from my own archive, including the favicon which was produced using an image featuring in the index gallery.
