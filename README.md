## Introduction 

***

This portfolio website was designed as a waypoint between social media and as a platform to view photography in more depth, whilst also providing methods of contacting the site owner, myself. Additional information such as a bio and a timeline of exhibitions will also be included.

This website was created as the first of four milestone projects as part of my Web Development Diploma at Code Institure. 

The primary requirements are that the website be responsive, static and uses HTML and CSS. The site must be at least 3 Pages.
